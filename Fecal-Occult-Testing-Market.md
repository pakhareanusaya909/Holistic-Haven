FOBT kits have evolved to provide quicker, more accurate results, which further boost their adoption in clinical settings. Moreover, with increasing healthcare expenditure globally, patients are more inclined to opt for non-invasive tests like FOBT, which offer a less uncomfortable and cost-effective alternative to traditional colonoscopies.
